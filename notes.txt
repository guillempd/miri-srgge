POSSIBILITY OF 3 APPLICATIONS:
    - Mesh preprocesser
    - Visibility calculator
    - Renderer

SESSION 3
    - Vertex clustering:
        - Compute the bounding box
        - Subdivide the bounding box in uniform grid (use hashmap)
        - Compute representative for each cell in the grid (use mean)
        - 4 LODS: Original + 64^3 + 128^3 + 256^3 (improvement: use edge length to compute size of uniform grid)

IF DOING OCTREES:
    - Few alternatives:
        1)
            - Starting from the root parent subdivide it and classify all nodes according to their position
            - Proceed recursively in the child nodes until maximum depth is achieved
        2)
            - Insert each vertex and subdivide all of the nodes that are found in the path from the root to its final position
            - The final position is determined using a max depth
        3)
            - Insert each vertex and subdivide once a node reaches a certain threshold of number of vertexs
