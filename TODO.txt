12/04/2021: Fix issue with bloq mayus (?)
13/04/2021: Put floor and walls for tilemap
13/04/2021: Constraint camera position to be only be at empty tilemap positions




28/04/2021: For each voxel

Insert corners instead of vertices

// For each face
    // Compute plane
    // Add plane to each of the vertices

// Solve the system using eigen (NO INVERSE) => Jacobi Decomposition ()
// Use Jacobi Decomposition
// Use extra precision for solving the system
// Be careful with coplanar faces / undetermined systems

// Use vertex normals

// Can compute octree more efficiently without needing to store all the vertices that fall into a cell
// Fer cub per octree
